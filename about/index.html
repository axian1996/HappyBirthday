<h1>Happy Your 21st Birthday My Babe!</h1>
<br>

<p>This is a website I made for your birthday especially, and it took me a while to sort everything out. </p>

<p>After today, we have known each other for more a year, and been together for almost a year. During the time we were together, we did travel a lot of places as you can see. Well, actually I did not expect that we went to that many places until I put all photos together, and what on this website is even not all of them. </p>

<p>This year is going to be a tough year as you are in L.A. and I am in Berkeley, but I believe that we are going to overcome this. This is not a big deal to us, and we will get together one day, which I truly believe it. </p>

<p>Anyway, I must be with you when you see this place, and I do hope you would kiss me after you see all these -3-</p>
